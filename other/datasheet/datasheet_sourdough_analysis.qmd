**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - To analyze pricing patterns in Toronto's sourdough bread market through the major retailers, the dataset was created. This helps close a gap in knowledge about how retailers price specialty bread products in urban markets and how retailers position themselves in that market through pricing strategy.
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - The dataset was created through Project Hammer [@filipp_2024_project], with daily price tracking across major Toronto retailers.
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - This dataset was compiled as part of academic research with no external funding.
4. *Any other comments?*
    - The dataset specifically focuses on sourdough bread to enable focused analysis of a specialty product category.

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances represent?*
	- Each instance represents a daily price observation for a sourdough bread product at a specific retailer in Toronto.
2. *How many instances are there in total?*
	- 1,485 price observations after cleaning
	- Covering 5 major retailers
	- Including multiple brands and product variants
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances?*
	- The dataset covers all major retail chains in Toronto
	- Some days may have missing observations due to stock unavailability
	- Geographic coverage limited to Toronto area
4. *What data does each instance consist of?*
	- Date of observation
	- Vendor name
	- Product description
	- Brand name
	- Price in CAD
	- Package size in grams
	- Calculated price per 100g

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data acquired?*
	- Direct observation of retail prices
	- Daily monitoring of both in-store and online prices
	- Manual verification of price accuracy
2. *What mechanisms were used?*
	- Standardized data collection protocol
	- Web scraping for online prices
	- Manual recording for in-store verification

**Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling**

1. *Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling done?*
	- Standardization of product names and brands
	- Conversion of all prices to price per 100g for comparison
	- Removal of invalid entries and out-of-stock items
	- Classification of product types (artisan, sliced, regular)
	- Treatment of missing values and outliers (>3 SD from mean)
2. *Was the "raw" data saved?*
	- Original data preserved in CSV format
	- Raw data stored in data/01-raw_data/raw_sourdough_prices.csv
	- Cleaned data saved as parquet file in data/02-analysis_data/
3. *Is the preprocessing software available?*
	- All cleaning scripts available in project repository
	- R scripts numbered 00-07 document complete workflow
	- Uses tidyverse [@wickham_2019_welcome] and arrow [@apachearrowdevelopers_2023_arrow] packages
